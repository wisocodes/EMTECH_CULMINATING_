        <h2>About the Resort</h2>
        <p>
            First established in 1998 as Panglao Island and Nature Resort, our 80-hectare haven has welcomed both local
            and international guests with warmth and care. Embraced by a half-kilometer stretch of pristine white sand,
            it is one of the few resorts on the island that can offer such natural beauty and a high level of privacy.
        </p>
        <p>
            After two decades of pampering thousands of visitors, Panglao Island and Nature Resort proudly rebranded as
            Ecology Resort in 2016, continuing its tradition of relaxation, comfort, and connection with nature.
